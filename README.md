# Problem Statement:
- More than 25% of entire revenue in E-Commerce is attributed to apparels & accessories.
-  A major problem they face is categorizing these apparels from just the images especially when the categories provided by the brands are inconsistent.
-  This poses an interesting computer vision problem which has caught the eyes of several deep learning researchers.
-  Fashion MNIST is a drop-in replacement for the very well known, machine learning hello world -
   MNIST dataset which can be checked out at ‘Identify the digits’ practice problem. Instead of digits, the images show a type of apparel e.g. T-shirt, trousers, bag, etc.
- he dataset used in this problem was created by Zalando Research
- The problem posed here is one of the classical and real-life problem posted in the DataHack plateform.
